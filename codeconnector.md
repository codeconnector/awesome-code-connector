## About Code Connector

> Helping communities through service. ~ Code Connector

## Our Mission

We are a community of passionate software developers that provide support, mentorship, and exposure to in-demand technologies and careers for adults from underrepresented groups or those making career transitions starting their tech journey.

## Support

It goes without saying, but it should be no surprise that our world and pockets of society have not always treated people fairly. No matter a person's gender, color, creed or situation, we want to empower the tech industry to serve and be led by all people.

## Mentorship

Whether through mentorship at one of our meetups or a conversation through our online chat community, we think people deserve free, no-strings-attached assistance.

## Exposure

When diving into a new trade and industry, it's incredibly hard to know where to go or who to talk with to get help. We take great pride in directing people to a next step that fits within their schedule and won't break the bank.

## Meet the Team
> Teamwork makes the Dream work.

For real though, the people listed below are the salt of the earth and deserve so many pats on the back. They lead meetups, develop project-based presentations, connect with potential partners, answer all sorts of questions, and generally keep this ship afloat. Looking to connect with good, driven, knowledgeable technologists? Look no further.
